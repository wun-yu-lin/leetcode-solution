# [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/)

Given an unsorted array of integers <code>nums</code>, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in<code>O(n)</code>time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code>. Therefore its length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>0 <= nums.length <= 10^5</code>
- <code>-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9</code>
