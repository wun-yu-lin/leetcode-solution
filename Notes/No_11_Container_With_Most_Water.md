# [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/)

You are given an integer array <code>height</code> of length <code>n</code>. There are <code>n</code> vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the <code>i^th</code> line are <code>(i, 0)</code> and <code>(i, height[i])</code>.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

**Notice**  that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**
<img alt="" src="https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 287px;">

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>n == height.length</code>
- <code>2 <= n <= 10^5</code>
- <code>0 <= height[i] <= 10^4</code>
